I have included my .vimrc and .inputrc.  The .vimrc file contains some things that make it easier to code, and the .inputrc has some key bindings for my terminal app.  It's a little pathetic, but I don't have much customization in . files in my OSX environment.  I don't have anything else at the moment.
