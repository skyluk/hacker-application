The application I have included stores information about a trip (miles, cost of fuel, fuel economy) and tells a user approximately how much fuel will cost for the trip.

The bulk of the code can be found in:

application/controllers/IndexController.php
application/views/scripts/index/index.phtml
application/models (database code)

The configuration file is:

application/configs/application.ini

The application uses the Zend framework (The framework files would normally be in library/ but to save space I did not include them).  The trip details are stored in a MySQL database in a single table that looks like this:

Table entries
=============
id, desc, drive_time, miles, cost, mpg
-------------
id           INT
desc         VARCHAR
drive_time   DECIMAL
miles        INT
cost         DOUBLE
mpg          INT


Everything works, but the only working example I have is on my local machine.
